-- combine1 generates a list of substrings (and their
-- positions to filter for overlap) by appending 1 codepoint
-- at a given offset to all substrings currently under
-- consideration.  There are 3 cases:
-- [1] Warmup: the substrings under consideration need to
--     be 3 chars or longer so if the range [prOffs, offs]
--     is shorter than that, we update the Digram
--     [a] Digram is incomplete (i.e. only one Char read,
--         offs == prOffs): accept updated Digram and
--         continue immediately: we don't have enough
--         information yet to do more.
--     [b] Digram is complete (i.e. offs - prOffs == 1)
--     inpTxt = "...0123456789..."
--       cp = 0x36 = '6' ^^       newDigram="56"
--                prOffs /\ offs
--         If that Digram occurs > 1, future EnnGram starting
--         with it might also occur several times, so
--         accept new Digram and continue immediately.
--         If that Digram only occurs once, all following
--         EnnGram will also only occur once, so restart
--         from current char (i.e. at offs)
-- [2] Restart: if any digram in the substrings was seen
--     less than twice, then all these substrings can also
--     only occur at most once, which means they aren't
--     interesting compression candidates and extending them
--     with more characters after that makes no sense either
--     so we restart from the current character
-- [3] Enqueue: if the total length is 3 or more characters
--     and the new digram occurs two times or more, all
--     current substrings need to be extended by that new
--     codepoint
--     inpTxt = "...0123456789..."
--       cp = 0x39 = '9' ^   ^
--                prOffs /   \ offs
--     Needs enqueuing 56789, 6789 and 789 (assumes that 89
--     occurs at least twice.
