-- Return array from Digram to occurence count.  This info
-- will be used to abort generation of EnnGram candidates to
-- count on the basis that if an EnnGram contains a Digram
-- that only occurs once, that EnnGram will also only occur
-- once and hence it makes no sense to count it in the hope
-- of compressing it.  This mechanism is also used to
-- prevent compression of parts across string boundaries
-- (the input is a list of strings represented as InputText)
-- by forcing all Digram containing the string separator
-- (\NUL) to an occur count of 0.
